        <h1>Coursework</h1>
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; In my time at JMU, I've had the opportunity to interact and
          code with multiple languages. In
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >CS149: Introduction to Programming,</span
          >
          I coded with Python in Thonny IDE to learn basic programming ideas and
          complete small projects and tasks.
          <br />
          &emsp; After that, in
          <span style="font-weight: 650">CS159: Advanced Programming,</span> I
          refreshed my high school memories of coding in Java, and started to
          work in Eclipse. I was introduced to object-orientated programming
          ideas such as class design, OOP project design, encapsulation,
          polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. Additionally, I used JUnit
          tests to perform automated testing on project requirements.
          <br />
          &emsp; Following that in sophomore year, I
        </p>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; Starting out with credit for Calculus 1 and 2, I first took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 237: Calculus 3</span> since I had
          taken it previously. The next semester, in pursuit of a minor, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 245: Discrete Mathematics</span>
          and <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 300: Linear Algebra</span>,
          two classes that introduced me to mathematical proofs. It wasn't until
          after these two classes that I actually declared a major in
          Mathematics. (Math was too interesting to stop after these).
          <br />
          &emsp; Following this, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >Math 430/431: Abstract Algebra 1 and 2,</span
          >
          which I found especially satisfying and opened me up to the space of
          higher mathematics and math research. During this time, I also took
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >Math 475: Fundamental Concepts of Geometry</span
          >. This class axiomatically built an understanding of geometry
          straight from Euclid's Elements, followed by delving into some
          non-euclidean concepts, the upper-half plane being one example. After
          that, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">MATH 485: Topics: Cryptography,</span>
          which explored the mathematics behind cryptography. Specifically,
          systems relying on modular arithmetic like RSA, as well as elliptic
          curve cryptography.
