        <h1>Coursework</h1>
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
          In my time at JMU, I've had the opportunity to interact and code with
          multiple languages. In
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >CS149: Introduction to Programming,</span
          >
          I coded with Python in Thonny IDE to learn basic programming ideas.
          After that, in
          <span style="font-weight: 650">CS159: Advanced Programming,</span> I
          coded in Java, and started to work in Eclipse. I was introduced to
          object-orientated programming ideas and things like unit testing,
          recursion, and project desing. Additionally, I used JUnit tests to
          perform automated testing on project requirements.
          <br />
          In sophomore year, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >CS240: Data Structures and Algorithms and CS345: Software
            Engieneering</span
          >. CS240 was the standard DSA class in things like arrays, queues,
          stacks, trees, sorting, searching, etc. CS345 introduced industry
          topics like development process, continous integration, agile methods,
          quality assurance, testing, and design principles. At the end of the
          semester, we practiced the Scrum methodology to create a movie
          searching database similar to IMDb.
          <br />
          After, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">CS261: Computer Systems I</span>, which
          taught me programming in C and working in Unix environments. It also
          built up computer systems from binary encodings, up through Assembly,
          machine architecture, and operating systems in general.
        </p>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
          Starting out with credit for Calculus 1 and 2, I first took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 237: Calculus 3</span>. The next
          semester, in pursuit of a minor, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 245: Discrete Mathematics</span>
          and <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 300: Linear Algebra</span>,
          two classes that introduced me to mathematical proofs. It wasn't until
          after these two classes that I actually declared a major in
          Mathematics. (Math was too interesting to stop after these).
          <br />
          Following this, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >Math 430/431: Abstract Algebra 1 and 2,</span
          >
          which I found especially satisfying and opened me up to the space of
          higher mathematics and math research. During this time, I also took
          <span style="font-weight: 650"
            >Math 475: Fundamental Concepts of Geometry</span
          >. This class axiomatically built an understanding of geometry
          straight from Euclid's Elements, followed by delving into some
          non-euclidean concepts, the upper-half plane being one example. After
          that, I took
          <span style="font-weight: 650">MATH 485: Topics: Cryptography,</span>
          which explored the mathematics behind cryptography. Specifically, RSA,
          square roots mod n, primality testing, discrete logarithms, elliptic
          curve cryptography, and hash functions.
