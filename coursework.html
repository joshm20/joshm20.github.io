      <h1>Coursework</h1>
      <h3>Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
        In my time at JMU, I've had the opportunity to interact and code with
        multiple languages. In
        <span style="font-weight: 650">CS149: Introduction to Programming,</span>
        I coded with Python in Thonny IDE to learn basic programming ideas.
        In
        <span style="font-weight: 650">CS159: Advanced Programming,</span> I
        coded in Java, and started to work in Eclipse. I was introduced to
        object-orientated programming ideas and things like unit testing,
        recursion, and project design. Additionally, I used JUnit tests to
        perform automated testing on project requirements.
        <br />
        I have taken also
        <span style="font-weight: 650">CS240: Data Structures and Algorithms and CS345: Software
          Engieneering</span>. CS240 was the standard DSA class in things like arrays, queues,
        stacks, trees, sorting, searching, etc. CS345 introduced industry
        topics like development process, continous integration, agile methods,
        quality assurance, testing, and design principles. At the end of the
        semester, we practiced the Scrum methodology to create a movie
        searching database similar to IMDb.
        <br />
        I have taken
        <span style="font-weight: 650">CS261/361: Computer Systems I/II</span>, which
        taught me programming in C and working in Unix environments. It also
        built up computer systems from binary encodings, up through Assembly,
        machine architecture, and operating systems in general. It explored concurrency with processes, multi-threading,
        and synchronization,
        as well as networking with the Internet Model including protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, DNS, and DHCP.
      </p>
      <h3>Mathematics</h3>
      <p>
        I have formal knowledge in Calculus 1, 2, and 3 (<span style="font-weight: 650">Math 237: Calculus 3</span>).
        I took <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 245: Discrete Mathematics</span>,
        and <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 300: Linear Algebra</span>,
        two classes that introduced me to mathematical proofs.
        <br />
        Following this, I took
        <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 430/431: Abstract Algebra 1 and 2,</span>
        which I found especially satisfying and opened me up to the space of
        higher mathematics and math research. During this time, I also took
        <span style="font-weight: 650">Math 475: Fundamental Concepts of Geometry</span>. This class axiomatically built
        an understanding of geometry
        straight from Euclid's Elements, followed by delving into some
        non-euclidean concepts, the upper-half plane being one example.
        For fun, I learned about cryptography in
        <span style="font-weight: 650">MATH 485: Topics: Cryptography,</span>
        which explored the mathematics behind cryptography. Specifically, RSA,
        square roots mod n, primality testing, discrete logarithms, elliptic
        curve cryptography, and hash functions.
        To round out my mathematical knowledge, I took <span style="font-weight: 650">MATH 410: Real Analysis</span>.
