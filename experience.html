        <h3>REU Site: End-User Programming of Cyber-Physical Systems (2024)</h3>
        <p>
          During the summer of 2024, I worked a research internship at Virginia
          Commonwealth University. I worked with graduate students and my
          advisor in the Mobile and Wireless Networking Group (MoWiNG) Lab. I
          completed a project on detecting sign language using WiFi signals.
        </p>

        <h3>Resident Advisor (2023-Current)</h3>
        <p>
          As a Resident Advisor at James Madison University, I supervise and
          support the well-being of 32 residents in a first-year residence hall.
          I am responsible for creating a safe and inclusive community,
          enforcing university policies, and providing resources to residents. I
          am also responsible for planning and executing programs that promote
          community and personal growth.
        </p>

        <h3>Mathematics Tutor (2024-Current)</h3>
        <p>
          As a mathematics tutor at James Madison University, I am responsible
          for helping students understand and complete their mathematics
          homework. I also provide resources to students and help develop study
          skills and create long term learning habits.
