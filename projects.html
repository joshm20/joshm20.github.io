      <h3>Pocket Accountant (HTML/CSS/JS)</h3>
      <p>
        Pocket Account is a personal finance solely client-side application that allows users to track their accounts,
        transactions, and net worth over time. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes
        the local storage API to persist data across sessions. The application uses Chart.js to visualize account
        balances
        over time, and uses Alpha Vantage's API to provide real-time stock prices for accurate account balances.
        The website is publicly accessible <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/makelajr/cs343/project/"

      <h3>URECord (MySQL, Python/Flask/Jinja, HTML/CSS)</h3>
      <p>
        In a databases class, I worked in a team of 4 to develop a database
        system. Our database system encompassed aspects of our JMU recreation
        center, 'UREC'. We constructed an entity-relationship diagram
        involving a few main parts: Employees, Members, Classes, and
        Intramurals. We then implemented this database in MySQL and created a
        webapp using Python's Flask framework. The webapp allows for basic
        CRUD operations on all tables, as well as advanced views, such as
        employee pay and intramural team performance.

      <h3>Terminal Spreadsheet (C++)</h3>
      <p>
        As part of a programming languages course, I was encouraged to develop
        my own programming language complete with lexing and parsing. I
        developed an expression model which polymorphically represented any
        expression that could be a token in my given language. Each token that
        extends an expression could then be evaluated and serialized into a
        string. I utilized ncurses to create a terminal interface for the
        spreadsheet program to allow for navigation and editing of the cells.

      <h3>JMDB (HTML/CSS/JS)</h3>
      <p>
        JMDB, aka "James Madison Database" is a educational imitation of
        popular movie searching sites like IMDb and Letterboxd. In CS345, our
        group wrote this using HTML, CSS, and the p5.js javascript library,
        the TMDB API, and utilizing scrum methodologies. I acted as Scrum
        Master by leading "daily" (whenever the class met) scrums, assigning
        tasks, and aligning project features to deliverables. Note the
        extremely professional logo design. This project was prior to any formal knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript,
        so it is a little crude compared to the quality I can produce now.

      <h3>Asteroids Clone (Java)</h3>
      <p>
        This was a clone of the popular game
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">
          Asteroids</a>
        made in Java using object oriented programming. Using OOP utilizes the
        power of inheritance and common features between things like the ship,
        asteroids, and the aliens. Things like collision, position updating,
        and object deletion can be handled similarly without any regard to
        specific attributes of a game element.
